[@FootyFan101 - March 1, 2025, 10:10 AM] 2026 can‚Äôt come soon enough! I‚Äôm already saving up for tickets. Who else is planning to go?
[@SoccerGuru22 - March 1, 2025, 10:12 AM] @FootyFan101 Same here! I‚Äôm hoping they release ticket details soon. Fingers crossed it‚Äôs not a lottery system.
[@PitchQueen45 - March 1, 2025, 10:15 AM] This is going to be epic! I just hope the matches are spread out so I can catch as many as possible. üèüÔ∏è‚öΩ
[@SportsFanatic99 - March 1, 2025, 10:18 AM] @PitchQueen45 Agreed! I‚Äôm hoping for a mix of East and West Coast venues. Road trip, anyone?
[@GoalDigger87 - March 1, 2025, 10:20 AM] @SportsFanatic99 Count me in! Let‚Äôs make it a fan caravan across the country. üöó‚öΩ
[@FootyFan101 - March 1, 2025, 10:22 AM] @GoalDigger87 That sounds like a dream! Imagine the atmosphere in every city. üî•
[@SoccerGuru22 - March 1, 2025, 10:25 AM] Does anyone know if they‚Äôll expand the number of teams again? 48 teams was already a lot in 2026.
[@PitchQueen45 - March 1, 2025, 10:28 AM] @SoccerGuru22 I think it‚Äôs staying at 48. But with more teams, more drama! Can‚Äôt wait for the underdog stories.
[@SportsFanatic99 - March 1, 2025, 10:30 AM] @PitchQueen45 True! The World Cup always delivers unforgettable moments. Who‚Äôs your dark horse for 2026?
[@GoalDigger87 - March 1, 2025, 10:32 AM] @SportsFanatic99 I‚Äôm keeping an eye on Canada. They‚Äôve been improving steadily. üçÅ‚öΩ
[@FootyFan101 - March 1, 2025, 10:35 AM] @GoalDigger87 Canada? Interesting choice! I‚Äôm betting on an African team making a deep run this time.
[@SoccerGuru22 - March 1, 2025, 10:38 AM] @FootyFan101 Senegal or Morocco could definitely shake things up. Their squads are looking strong.
[@PitchQueen45 - March 1, 2025, 10:40 AM] @SoccerGuru22 Morocco was so close last time! I‚Äôd love to see them go all the way. üèÜ
[@SportsFanatic99 - March 1, 2025, 10:42 AM] @PitchQueen45 Same here! The World Cup always brings out the best in teams. Let‚Äôs hope for some surprises.
[@GoalDigger87 - March 1, 2025, 10:45 AM] @SportsFanatic99 Surprises are what make it fun! Remember when Croatia made the final in 2018? Iconic.
[@FootyFan101 - March 1, 2025, 10:48 AM] @GoalDigger87 That run was legendary! Modriƒá was on another level that year. üêê
[@SoccerGuru22 - March 1, 2025, 10:50 AM] @FootyFan101 Modriƒá is a once-in-a-generation player. It‚Äôll be interesting to see who steps up in 2026.
[@PitchQueen45 - March 1, 2025, 10:52 AM] @SoccerGuru22 I‚Äôm excited to see the next wave of talent. Maybe a young star will emerge and steal the show.
[@SportsFanatic99 - March 1, 2025, 10:55 AM] @PitchQueen45 That‚Äôs the beauty of the World Cup. It‚Äôs where legends are made. Who‚Äôs your pick for breakout star?
[@GoalDigger87 - March 1, 2025, 10:58 AM] @SportsFanatic99 I‚Äôm keeping an eye on that young Brazilian forward. He‚Äôs been tearing it up in Europe.
[@FootyFan101 - March 1, 2025, 11:00 AM] @GoalDigger87 Oh, you mean Vitor Roque? Kid‚Äôs got serious potential. Can‚Äôt wait to see him on the big stage.
[@SoccerGuru22 - March 1, 2025, 11:02 AM] @FootyFan101 Vitor Roque is a beast! But let‚Äôs not forget about the European talents. Musiala is another one to watch.
[@PitchQueen45 - March 1, 2025, 11:05 AM] @SoccerGuru22 Musiala is pure class. Germany might have a real shot if he keeps developing like this.
[@SportsFanatic99 - March 1, 2025, 11:08 AM] @PitchQueen45 Germany always brings it in the World Cup. I‚Äôm curious to see how they bounce back after 2022.
[@GoalDigger87 - March 1, 2025, 11:10 AM] @SportsFanatic99 They‚Äôve got a young squad now. It‚Äôs all about rebuilding and getting that chemistry right.
[@FootyFan101 - March 1, 2025, 11:12 AM] @GoalDigger87 True, but don‚Äôt count out the usual suspects. France and Argentina are still stacked.
[@SoccerGuru22 - March 1, 2025, 11:15 AM] @FootyFan101 Argentina will be defending champs. The pressure will be on, but they‚Äôve got Messi‚Äôs legacy to play for.
[@PitchQueen45 - March 1, 2025, 11:18 AM] @SoccerGuru22 Messi might not be there in 2026, but his influence will still be felt. What a career!
[@SportsFanatic99 - March 1, 2025, 11:20 AM] @PitchQueen45 Messi‚Äôs World Cup win was the perfect ending to his story. But I‚Äôm ready for the next chapter!
[@GoalDigger87 - March 1, 2025, 11:22 AM] @SportsFanatic99 Same here! The World Cup always delivers new heroes. Who‚Äôs next? ü§î
[@FootyFan101 - March 1, 2025, 11:25 AM] @GoalDigger87 I‚Äôm betting on Mbapp√© to finally lead France to another title. He‚Äôs due for a big tournament.
[@SoccerGuru22 - March 1, 2025, 11:28 AM] @FootyFan101 Mbapp√© is a monster. If he stays healthy, France will be unstoppable.
[@PitchQueen45 - March 1, 2025, 11:30 AM] @SoccerGuru22 Agreed, but don‚Äôt sleep on Brazil. They‚Äôve got a point to prove after 2022.
[@SportsFanatic99 - March 1, 2025, 11:32 AM] @PitchQueen45 Brazil always brings the flair. I just hope they can balance it with solid defense this time.
[@GoalDigger87 - March 1, 2025, 11:35 AM] @SportsFanatic99 Defense wins championships! Brazil needs to tighten up at the back if they want to go far.
[@FootyFan101 - March 1, 2025, 11:38 AM] @GoalDigger87 True, but their attack is so fun to watch. I‚Äôm here for the samba football! üéâ
[@SoccerGuru22 - March 1, 2025, 11:40 AM] @FootyFan101 Samba football is the best! Let‚Äôs hope they bring that energy to the USA in 2026.
[@PitchQueen45 - March 1, 2025, 11:42 AM] @SoccerGuru22 The atmosphere is going to be electric. I can already imagine the chants and celebrations.
[@SportsFanatic99 - March 1, 2025, 11:45 AM] @PitchQueen45 The USA knows how to host big events. This is going to be a World Cup to remember!
