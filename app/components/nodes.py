                Your task is to generate a fully compliant X12 837 Professional EDI claim file based on the provided details. 
                Strictly adhere to EDI formatting rules and include all necessary segments (e.g., ISA, GS, ST, BHT, NM1, HL, CLM, SV1, DTP, etc.) 
                as mandated by the ANSI X12 standard.

                Key Instructions:
                Review Comments: Carefully incorporate or address the review comments, if any, provided in {comments}.
                Segment Hierarchy: Use the correct segment identifiers and maintain the hierarchical structure required for an 837 Professional EDI claim.
                Data Handling: Populate the EDI fields with the provided information, leaving placeholders (e.g., ~) for any mandatory segments where data is not available.
                Validation: Ensure the generated EDI file is ready for submission, compliant with validation requirements, and includes all required data elements.
                Output: Provide the result as raw EDI text, beginning with the ISA segment and including all required segments. Avoid explanations, comments, or any extra formatting.
                Review and Feedback:
                You are expected to incorporate expert review comments where applicable and make necessary corrections for compliance.
                Example Workflow:
                Include all control segments (ISA, GS, etc.).
                Ensure accurate provider (NM1) and patient (HL) data segments.
                Correctly format claim details (CLM, SV1) and date (DTP) segments.
                Validate the hierarchical structure of the document.
                Output Format:
                Your output must start with ISA and include all required segments in the EDI format. Do not provide explanations, extra formatting, or comments in the output.
